# Impaled - Changelog:

### Impaled 1.0.3 - 1.18.1
Introduces heated Hellfork balance changes:
- Heated Hellforks will no longer put their user on fire when held. No more awkward hotbar (haha) scrolls that put you on fire!
- Heated Hellforks with Riptide will now deal 2 (1 heart) damage upon use if the user is not already on fire. This damage bypasses armor and Protection enchantments, but can be avoided if the user has the fire resistance effect.

### Impaled 1.0.2 - 1.18
- Updated to Minecraft 1.18

### Impaled 1.0.1 - 1.17
- Updated to Minecraft 1.17
