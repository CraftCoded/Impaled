# Impaled

## Features
- Three new trident variants:
    - Pitchfork: for early game, lower damage, normal projectile drag underwater, allows for farmland tiling
    - Hellfork: Nether variant of the Trident
        - Ignites entities upon hit, whether thrown or used as a melee weapon
        - Changed the Riptide use from water based to fire based, when the user is on fire or inside lava
        - Accepts a unique curse that ignites the user when holding the hellfork
    - Elder Trident: an improved trident with homing capabilities
        - Will home on entities and come back for them (if it hasn't hit anything or the ground)
        - Channeling additionally grants the exact same effect as an Elder Guardian on players upon hitting them when thrown (apparition + mining fatigue)
- A new level for the Loyalty Enchant, Loyalty IV (also known as Sincere Loyalty), dropping the Trident as an entity when tossing the item, allowing you to recall it whenever you want when right clicking with an empty hand
