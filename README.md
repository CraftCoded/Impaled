# Impaled

## Features
- Four new trident variants:
    - Pitchfork: for early game, lower damage, normal projectile drag underwater, allows for farmland tiling
    - Hellfork: Nether variant of the Trident
        - Ignites entities upon hit, whether thrown or used as a melee weapon
        - Changed the Riptide use from water based to fire based, when the user is on fire or inside lava
        - Accepts a unique curse that ignites the user when holding the hellfork
        - Instead of how it works normally, Impaling will do one extra heart of damage per level to all fire immune entities (entities with Fire Resistance included!)
    - Elder Trident: an improved trident with homing capabilities
        - Will home on entities and come back for them (if it hasn't hit anything or the ground)
        - Upon killing an entity, the Elder Trident will catch its loot, giving it back when a player picks the trident up, or bringing it back to you if the trident has loyalty!
        - Channeling additionally grants the exact same effect as an Elder Guardian on players upon hitting them when thrown (apparition + mining fatigue)
        - Riptide works completely differently on this trident and will instead create one Guardian Trident copy per Riptide level. Riptide will not launch the Elder Trident and still requires the user to be under the water or in the rain.
    - Atlan: a legendary golden Trident, with an enchantability matching its material
        - Accepts all Trident enchantments, as well as Sword enchantments
- A new level for the Loyalty Enchant, Loyalty IV (also known as Sincere Loyalty), that drops the Trident as an entity when tossing the item, allowing you to recall it whenever you want when right clicking with an empty hand
- Total change to how Impaling work now dealing extra damage to entities in the rain or in water instead of aquatic creatures
    - Only adds 0.75 heart of damage per level instead of 1.25.
- A new powerful item, the Maelstrom, that allows its user to throw tridents out of their inventory
    - Accepts Efficiency (reduces the time between each trident launch), Unbreaking and Mending
